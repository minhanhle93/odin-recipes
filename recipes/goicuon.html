        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Goi Cuon, often referred to as Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, is a delightful dish that embodies the essence of Vietnamese cuisine in every bite. These translucent, delicate rice paper rolls are filled with a medley of fresh and vibrant ingredients, making them a perfect embodiment of the country's love for wholesome and balanced flavors. To create Goi Cuon, tender rice paper sheets are soaked briefly in warm water, making them pliable for rolling.</p>
        <p>A traditional filling comprises thinly sliced shrimp, fragrant herbs like mint and Thai basil, rice vermicelli noodles, and often, tender strips of poached pork or tofu for a vegetarian option. The art of rolling these treasures lies in folding the sides inward, then carefully enclosing the fillings to form a neat, cylindrical package. Served with a dipping sauce typically made from hoisin sauce, peanut butter, and a hint of chili, Goi Cuon is a refreshingly light and healthful appetizer or snack that captures the essence of Vietnamese cuisine's freshness and balance.</p>
